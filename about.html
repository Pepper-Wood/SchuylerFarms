    <h1 class="text-center">Greetings from Schuyler Farms</h1>
    <p>My name is Jerry, and I'd like to share the story of our family farm with you...</p>

    <p>Over 50 years ago Anna and Silk Macica settled down in historic Schuylerville, NY to build an honest life centered on hard work and family values. Raising seven children and running a dairy farm was a challenging, but rewarding life. Years after the passing of our Dad (We lost Dad in 1984 and in 2008 we sadly lost our loving and caring Mom), it was realized that like so many other farms, we could not support our families with the dairy business alone. Reluctantly, it was decided that we must change our business, sell the cows and adapt to the changing environment around us. My brothers, Tom, Ken and I put our heads together and redefined our family dairy farm into a place that now has something for everyone. We felt that an agritourism and family fun center would not only keep our family farm alive, but also benefit our community and establish traditions for years to follow.&nbsp; Our family has enjoyed the beautiful countryside and breathtaking sunsets at Schuyler Farms for generations, and now we invite you to come and share it with us.</p>

    <p>When the doors of Schuyler Farms opened to the public for the first time in August of 2002, we proudly displayed our first corn maze that was created, designed, cut and maintained by my brothers and me. Over the past several years, we have designed many more themes into our maze, and continue to proudly state that we are responsible for the entire process from the idea to the hands on creation. Every year we welcome more families that return to "get lost" in our corn maze. In addition to the maze, we offer many more attractions such as hayrides, pick-your-own pumpkins, miniature golf, gemstone, and fossil mining, petting zoo, gift shop, farm fresh snacks, haunted corn maze, a complete garden center, incredible sunsets, and so much more!</p>

    <p>So please stop by our farm to say hello. We guarantee you’ll want to keep coming back time and again to "get lost" in our maze, enjoy the family atmosphere and build some traditions of your own. We look forward to meeting you!</p>
